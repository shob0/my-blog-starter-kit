If we did, we would do something else.</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Health as defined by WHO is an state. An state of complete physical, mental\nand social well being: Not only the absence of disease.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<p>So, find out what is the mental state you are in most of the time. This is a pretty good indicator of how healthy you are. Maybe you get tired easily, or get stressed or anxious and later realize it was not that big a deal. Another good side of this is that you can always work and become healthier: no matter where are you right now.</p>\n<p>one more way of finding out this is how adaptible you are to new physical and environmental changes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Experience: I always feel less jet-lagged when I am in a good mental and physical shape.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/4b319/jason-briscoe-.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Jason briscoe beach\"\n        title=\"Jason briscoe beach\"\n        src=\"/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/1c72d/jason-briscoe-.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/a80bd/jason-briscoe-.jpg 148w,\n/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/1c91a/jason-briscoe-.jpg 295w,\n/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/1c72d/jason-briscoe-.jpg 590w,\n/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/a8a14/jason-briscoe-.jpg 885w,\n/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/fbd2c/jason-briscoe-.jpg 1180w,\n/static/67d27205d95fe2d47ab213ad46bd6496/4b319/jason-briscoe-.jpg 5472w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fitness, which is very different from health can be considered as an state of health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It can mean different things to different people. For a young adult, it can be related to his ability to perform particular task or a high intensity sport. For a middle aged household, it can mean to perform everyday tasks without getting tired.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ANYONE CAN BE HEALTHY. We just have to focus on out nutrition, exercise and take proper rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here with this blog, I will try to share what I have learnt in my 4 years of journey. I will also be sharing technical information on each component of a good health.
