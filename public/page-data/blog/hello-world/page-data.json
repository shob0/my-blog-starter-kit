For a young adult, it can be related to his ability to perform particular sports or a high intensity sport. For a middle aged household, it can mean to perform everyday tasks without getting tired.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ANYONE CAN BE HEALTHY. We just have to focus on out nutrition, exercise and proper rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here with this blog, I will try to share what I have learnt in my 4 years of journey. I will also be sharing technical information on each component of a good health. Keep watching.</p>\n<p>I have learnt these by courses provided by INFS <a href=\"https://infs.co.in\">Know More.</a></p>\n<p>Thanks and welcome to this journey.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Namaste Everyone","date":"May 31, 2020","description":"Hello People"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
