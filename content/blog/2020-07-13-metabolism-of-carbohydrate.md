## Metabolism

You have till now understood the different types of carbohydrate. You also know how simple and complex carbohydrates get treated.

**But What happens when you eat carbs? How does it gets converted to energy.**

Carbs eaten gets converted to glucose through a process of metabolism. This process starts as soon as you put the food in your mouth and it gets mixed with saliva (Salivary Amylase). The end product of metabolism is glucose or monosaccharides which is then transported to cells for further breakdown and production of energy.

Once carb is mixed with Salivary Amylase, it is sent to small intestine for digestion. Most of the carb is digested here in presence of pancreatic amylase. In the presence of this enzyme, carbs are converted into glucose or monosaccharides.

Some starch which does not get digested in the small intestine are digested by large intestine.

*The carbs which was eaten (no matter if it was simple or complex) is now converted into its smallest form. **Glucose.** But can that be used for energy.*

The process of converting glucose to usable energy (ATP) is performed in the cell and is called glycolysis. Its a process to breakdown glucose into even further elements. The end product of the glycolysis is ATP. This happens inside each cell.

This process can happen with or without oxygen. The process in presence of oxygen is called aerobic and the process in absence of oxygen is called anaerobic. Anaerobic is faster compared to aerobic but is less efficient (in terms of ATP produced per cycle).

*This was the process for an carb molecule to be converted into energy to provide energy to the cells to function their daily activities. What happens when your body doesn't need any more energy. The cells cannot just keep producing energy.*

This is handled by a process called glycogenesis. By Glycogenesis, the excess glucose molecules after digestion are attached together as chains to be stored in glycogens. This is the inverter from our previous discussion. Glycogens can be stored in the liver in small amount and in muscles in large amount. When your muscles feel bigger after consuming lots of carbs, it is because of glycogen stores are full.

Now you know the logic behind the digestion of the food and how it gets converted into ATPs to provide energy.

There are few technical terms which are used when we are describing the food. It is better to understand these in order to communicate technically.

### Glycemic index:

GI or Glycemic index is an indicator of how fast a food gets converted into glucose. It does not take into account the amount of food. So 100gms of sugar will have same GI as 10000gms. This makes the GI a inefficient measurement of food quality. Second example, Chips has less GI than oatmeal but it is easier to consume a lot of chips compared to oatmeal.



**GI = (blood glucose level after consuming product containing 50g of carbs/blood glucose level after consuming 50g of glucose)*100**

GI of a food changes when we mixed two different kind of GI foods. However, GI should not be given much though as it does not provide a clear picture of the quality of the food.

### Glycemic Load:

Glycemic load (GL) is calculated by how much carbohydrate will raise a person's blood sugar level after eating it. Glycemic load is calculated by multiplying the GI with available carbs in a product and dividing it by 100. This fixes the problem with GI.

GL = (GI * gram of carbs in food)/100

In the next chapter we will learn the use of carbohydrate and what role does it play in nutrition of our body.
