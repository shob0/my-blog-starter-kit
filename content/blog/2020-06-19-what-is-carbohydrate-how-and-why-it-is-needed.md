Now that we know how much we are going to eat, we need to understand how to divide our food. It is okay to use amount the way you want but body has certain requirements. You cannot just eat carbohydrates and expect everything would be okay. Body **requires** fat as well as protein. 

Protein, Fat and carbohydrate combined are called *Macros*. It is an abbreviation for Macro Nutrients. These are the nutrients which are essential for the body and are consume major portion of your diet.

One less heard part of diet is called Micro Nutrients. These are the nutrients which are also essential but are taken in a very small amount. Taking a lot of these can cause toxicity. They are generally not considered white creating the diet as most of them are present in the food that we eat. They are mainly vitamins and minerals ex, zinc, magnesium, etc.

We will explore all of the above. Brace yourself people, long stuff is coming.

# **Carbohydrate:**

Carbohydrates or carbs are usually found in most of the food. Healthy or junk. What we need to understand is what kind of carbs are you taking.

### What carbs do:

Carbs when consumed, are converted into smallest possible form of glucose and then to energy to make various human activities function properly.

### **What happens when you eat too much of carbs:**

Human body handles carbs in three ways:

1. Converts carbs to glucose and those glucose molecules to energy and use it for various internal and external activities.
2. Excess carbs are converted into glucose and stored in the various glycogen stores in the body. There are only a limited number of glycogen stores in the body.
3. Excess carbs which cannot be stored in the glycogen stores are converted into glucose and store it into the adipose tissues or simply called fats. There is no limit on how much adipose tissue body can create.

##### Carbohydrates are also called Saccharides.

> **One gram of carbohydrate produces 4 calories.** 

## Simple and Complex carbohydrates.

Simple carbs are made up of one or two molecules and are converted to energy relatively fast compared to complex carbohydrate.

Complex carbohydrates are basically starches and fibers. They are made of more than two molecules. and take a little more time to be converted to energy.

Here comes the role of insulin. Simple carbohydrates gives a spike in body insulin level and comes down to their normal state relatively fast compared to complex carbs.

Simple carbs can be further divided into two parts:

1. Monosaccharides: 1 glucose unit, smallest possible unit. Found as glucose, fructose, and galactose.
2. Disaccharides: 2 unit of monosaccharides joined by on covalent bond. Found as lactose, sucralose, maltose, trehalose.

Complex carbs can also be divided into two parts:

1. Oligosaccharides: 3 or more units of monosaccharides are joined by covalent bonds in order to form a short chain. They are digested by bacteria in the body rather than human digestive system.
2. Polysaccharides: Long chains of monosaccharides (only glucose). can range up to thousands.

It has gotten too technical right?

In short all you need to understand is how much calories does a gram of carbohydrate produces. It is 4. It's a good idea to eat complex carbohydrates as they are digested slowly and won't make you feel hungry soon. (Slow release of insulin). Simple carbohydrates are sugar molecules, like candy. Complex carbohydrates are rice, oats, etc.

In the next post, we will explore how body digests carbs. What happens when you eat carbs.
