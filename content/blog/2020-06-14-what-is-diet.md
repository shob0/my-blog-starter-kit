# Does the above image scare you?

What comes to your mind when you hear the word diet? 

Is it a plate of vegetables which you imagine to be bland and tasteless? Or a full blown meal containing only juice. Are you scared of this word. You have tried and failed and now believe that it does not work.

Let's take one thing at a time.

## **What is a diet?**

As per the definition, Diet is *the kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats.* 

So any food items that you eat through a day is said to be your diet. It is not limited to vegetables or fruits. Everything from rice to your sugar rush fix comes under the word diet.

## So why do people say *Are you on a diet?*

Well, there are many things said by people which mean different things. That is how language gets evolved: not by someone defining in a dictionary but the way people use it. 

> Fun Fact:  Diet is also a verb which means *restrict oneself to small amounts or special kinds of food in order to lose weight.*

When people do ask the above question, what they actually are asking is *Are you on a calorie restricted diet? Are you watching what and how much you are consuming?*

### Now you may ask what is this calorie, I remember it in school as a unit of energy but how it is related to diet?

You are right!

Calorie is a unit of energy. And we use it in nutrition to understand the proper usage of energy.

Look for a fan that you have in your house. How does it run?

With electrical energy, right? 

From where do you get that electrical energy?

Usually from electricity company.

What if there is a failure or a wire is broken by storm?

Then we have inverters which provides electricity.

Correct, This is how our body functions as well. Your food is your electricity company. When you consume it, the body processes it and converts it into energy. That energy is used by your body for daily activities.

The fat muscles in your body is your inverters. When you don't eat enough food, your body taps into inverter and uses that to do its work.

*So does this mean being fat is good. I have more energy stored then I can survive longer.*

Ummm!! Are you expecting any famine in near future? If yes, then kind of yes, being fat is good. Otherwise NO.

Generally, We are living in a very safe time of the world. Famine is least of our worries, Heck, many of us don't even know how food gets produced. We have proper supply of food so it is not required to store a lot of energy.

So coming back to topic, you have a company which is providing you electricity. Another one, storing for emergencies. Now with simple calculation, you can understand how to eat or not eat.

* *if* Energy spent *is greater than* Energy consumed: You will use your inverter hence you will lose fat.
* *if* Energy Spent *is less than* Energy consumed: you will store more fat into those inverter.

Remember, this inverter does not have a limit. It will keep storing the more it gets.

Probably now you can understand how you can lose fat or increase weight (Though it is a bit more complicated, we will get into it). All you have to do is to understand how much you are eating and how much are you spending. 

Simple right!!!
