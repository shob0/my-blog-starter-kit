# We don't know what is good for us. If we knew, we would do something else.

> Health as defined by WHO is an state. An state of complete physical, mental
> and social well being: Not only the absence of disease.

So in which state you are in most of the time in your day defines how healthy you are. If you easily get tired, or get stressed or anxious easily, even when you "seem" healthy, You might work and become a lot healthier. In the end, you will be more adaptible to new physical and environmental changes changes.

> Self Experience: I feel less jet lagged when I am working out and focusing on my health.

> Fitness, which is very different from health can be considered an state of health.

It can mean different things to different people. For a young adult, it can be related to his ability to perform particular sports or a high intensity sport. For a middle aged household, it can mean to perform everyday tasks without getting tired.

> ANYONE CAN BE HEALTHY. We just have to focus on out nutrition, exercise and proper rest.

Here with this blog, I will try to share what I have learnt in my 4 years of journey. I will also be sharing technical information on each component of a good health. Keep watching.

I have learnt these by courses provided by INFS [Know More.](https://infs.co.in)

Thanks and welcome to this journey.
