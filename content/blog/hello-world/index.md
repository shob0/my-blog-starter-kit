# We don't know what is good for us. If we did, we would do something else.

> Health as defined by WHO is an state. An state of complete physical, mental
> and social well being: Not only the absence of disease.

<br/>

So, find out what is the mental state you are in most of the time. This is a pretty good indicator of how healthy you are. Maybe you get tired easily, or get stressed or anxious and later realize it was not that big a deal. Another good side of this is that you can always work and become healthier: no matter where are you right now.

one more way of finding out this is how adaptible you are to new physical and environmental changes.

> Fitness, which is very different from health can be considered as an state of health.

It can mean different things to different people. For a young adult, it can be related to his ability to perform particular task or a high intensity sport. For a middle aged household, it can mean to perform everyday tasks without getting tired.

> ANYONE CAN BE HEALTHY. We just have to focus on out nutrition, exercise and take proper rest.

Here with this blog, I will try to share what I have learnt in my 4 years of journey. I will also be sharing technical information on each component of a good health. Keep watching.

I have learnt these by courses provided by INFS [Know More.](https://infs.co.in)

Thanks and welcome to this journey.
