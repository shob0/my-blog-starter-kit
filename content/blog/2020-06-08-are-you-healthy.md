## Thank  yourself for something that you did today. If only thing you did was survive, thank yourself for that.

We have now understood what health is and also, know, that with proper effort, we can achieve good fitness. 

Now suppose you started working out and eating properly. How will you decide your health is improving.

Is it based on the image you see in mirror? Or the number on a scale? Or something else! 

Well, Whereas above methods are good, they can be deceptive. One can be extremely slim but still lack the proper fitness like uneven level of vitamins or blood pressure.

**So what ARE the parameters?**

Hmmmm! There are certain ways defined for this.

In order to identify what your health status is, you can look for the these qualities:

1. Clear skin and eyes.
2. Healthy digestion process
3. Optimum energy level
4. Proper bowel movements
5. Clear urination
6. Normal Satiety level
7. Strong teeth, gums, nails and hair
8. Good memory and concentration
9. Good emotional stability
10. Good Flexibility in joints and muscles

Do you think you have above parameters? *If Yes, good. If No, You will.*



Now, as you know, health and fitness are two different things. Fitness is crucial and requires continues practice, in order to maintain the above state of health. It is not like something you once achieve and then it's over.

> **Perfection is a Work in Progress, never done!!**

 So, **how can you measure your fitness.** 

Well, similar to health, There are few parameters of fitness as well. It depends on person to person so you can understand and decide which one you like and want to maximize.

*Generally, It's always a better to have a good proportion of all of these.*

* **Muscular Endurance:** How many repetitions of an exercise you can perform. Like how many pushups or squats.
* **Muscular Strength:** How much external weight can be moved in relation to repetitions. Usually measured by bench press or weighted squats.
* **Cardiorespiratory Endurance:** How long or fast an activity can be performed and its impact on heart rate and oxygen  consumption.
* **Muscular Power:** How much force can be generated during a given activity.  Its a function of movement over a given frame of time.
* **Flexibility:** How far a muscle group can be stretched.
* **Balance:** How long a position can be held. Ex: standing one one log
* **Speed:** How fast one can move form point A to point B.
* **Body Composition:** Body's composition in relation to fat, muscle, lean muscle, water, etc.

Now that you understand what are these, Identify where you stand and where do you want to go. Start wherever you are and you will reach where you want to go. I know you will!!
